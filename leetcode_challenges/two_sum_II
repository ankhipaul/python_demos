#Dont do two sum II with hash map as the input array is sorted, it will take more time to make a hashmap. Use two pointer.

def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l = 0
        r = len(numbers) -1
        while l< r:
          summation = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
          if summation > target : #17>9
            r -=1
          elif summation < target:
            l += 1
          else:
            return [l+1, r+1]
        return []
